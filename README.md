# AI Backend Sprint: 12 Days to Intelligence

Project Codename: AI-Backend-Sprint  
Objective: Evolve from deterministic if else backends to probabilistic AI driven systems

This repository is a living engineering log documenting a 12 day intensive sprint into AI augmented backend development.

The focus is on production minded AI systems designed for Python backend engineers working with Django Flask and AWS.

---

## Philosophy

Traditional backends are predictable rule bound and explicit.  
AI backends are probabilistic contextual and adaptive.

This sprint explores how to:

- Treat AI as infrastructure not magic
- Replace brittle logic trees with model mediated decisions
- Build systems that are observable testable and deployable

---

## Tech Stack

### Language
- Python 3.11+

### AI and Models
- OpenAI API
- Anthropic
- AWS Bedrock

### Vector Databases
- ChromaDB (local)
- Pinecone (cloud)

### Backend Frameworks
- Flask (microservices)
- Django (full stack)

### Infrastructure
- Docker
- Jenkins
- AWS

## Setup

Requirements
- Python 3.11
- Docker
- AWS credentials

Steps

```
git clone <repo-url>  
cd ai-backend-sprint 
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

---

## Future Work

- Domain specific RAG experiments
- GPU optimized containers
- Voice to text backend control
- Policy driven AI agents

## Closing

This repository is not about learning AI APIs.

It is about understanding how AI changes backend architecture.

Determinism was safety.  
Probability is leverage.
