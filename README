# AI-Backend Sprint: 12 Days to Intelligence

**Project Codename:** Cosmonyx-AI-Core  
**Objective:** Evolve from deterministic if/else backends to probabilistic, AI-driven systems.

This repository is a **living engineering log** documenting a 12-day intensive sprint into AI-augmented backend development.

The focus is on **production-minded AI systems**, not demos—designed for Python backend engineers working with Django, Flask, and AWS.

---

## Philosophy

Traditional backends are predictable, rule-bound, and explicit.  
AI backends are probabilistic, contextual, and adaptive.

This sprint explores how to:

- Treat AI as **infrastructure**, not magic
- Replace brittle logic trees with **model-mediated decisions**
- Build systems that are **observable, testable, and deployable**

---

## Tech Stack

### Core Language
- Python 3.11+

### AI & Model Access
- OpenAI API
- Anthropic
- AWS Bedrock

### Vector Infrastructure
- ChromaDB (local development)
- Pinecone (managed cloud)

### Backend Frameworks
- Flask (microservices and AI gateways)
- Django (full-stack and orchestration)

### Infrastructure
- Docker (multi-stage, minimal images)
- Jenkins (CI/CD)
- AWS (IAM, Bedrock, S3)
