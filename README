Since you are a backend engineer who values clean infrastructure and has a penchant for the cosmos (shoutout to **Cosmonyx**), let's build a README that feels like a professional engineering log.

This layout is designed to be a "living document" that tracks your evolution from a deterministic developer to an AI-integrated engineer.

# 🌌 AI-Backend Sprint: 12 Days to Intelligence

> **Project Codename:** Cosmonyx-AI-Core
> **Objective:** Transitioning from deterministic `if/else` logic to probabilistic AI-driven backend systems.

This repository serves as a technical log and codebase for a 12-day intensive sprint into AI Engineering, specifically tailored for a Python-centric backend stack (Django/Flask/AWS).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.11+
* **AI Orchestration:** OpenAI API / Anthropic / AWS Bedrock
* **Vector Infrastructure:** ChromaDB (Local) / Pinecone (Cloud)
* **Backend Frameworks:** Flask (for microservices) / Django (for full-stack)
* **Infrastructure:** Docker (Optimized Multi-stage builds)

## 📓 Daily Engineering Logs

### Day 01: The Structured Bridge

* **Problem:** Converting "human chaos" (unstructured text) into "machine order" (JSON).
* **Key Learning:** Using `response_format={ "type": "json_object" }` to ensure API reliability.
* **Code:** [`/day-01-json-parsing`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./day-01-json-parsing)
* **Reflection:** AI isn't just a chatbot; it's a dynamic data parser that saves hours of Regex work.

## 🚀 Setup & Execution

### Environment

1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Setup Venv: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install Deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure `.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-1

```

## 🔭 Future Horizons

* Deep-dive into Dinosaur Taxonomies (for RAG testing data).
* Optimizing GPU-based container builds.
* Integrating Voice-to-Text for seamless backend command execution.
