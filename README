# 🌌 AI-Backend Sprint: 12 Days to Intelligence

> **Project Codename:** `Cosmonyx-AI-Core`  
> **Objective:** Evolve from deterministic `if/else` backends to probabilistic, AI-driven systems.

This repository is a **living engineering log** documenting a 12-day intensive sprint into AI-augmented backend development.  
The focus is on **production-minded AI systems**, not demos—designed for Python backend engineers working with Django, Flask, and AWS.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

Traditional backends are predictable, rule-bound, and explicit.  
AI backends are probabilistic, contextual, and adaptive.

This sprint explores how to:
- Treat AI as **infrastructure**, not magic
- Replace brittle logic trees with **model-mediated decisions**
- Build systems that are **observable, testable, and deployable**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core Language
- Python 3.11+

### AI & Model Access
- OpenAI API  
- Anthropic  
- AWS Bedrock

### Vector Infrastructure
- ChromaDB (local development)
- Pinecone (managed cloud)

### Backend Frameworks

- Django (full-stack & orchestration)

### Infrastructure
- Docker (multi-stage, minimal images)
- Jenkins (CI/CD)
- AWS (IAM, Bedrock, S3)

## 📓 Engineering Logs

### Day 01 — The Structured Bridge

**Problem**  
Transforming unstructured human input into reliable machine-readable data.

**Key Learning**  
Schema-constrained outputs dramatically reduce downstream complexity.

**Implementation**
- Enforced structured responses using JSON schemas
- Eliminated fragile regex-based parsing
